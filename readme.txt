# üåæ Hami-Kisaan ‚Äî AI-Powered Farming Assistant

Hami-Kisaan is a full-stack AI-powered agricultural platform that helps farmers make smarter decisions.

It integrates crop recommendations, plant disease detection, weather alerts, map-based disease tracking, and a marketplace for farmers to buy and sell crops.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, Whisper AI, Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Frontend:** React, Vite
- **AI Models:** Faster Whisper for audio transcription, custom ML models for disease detection
- **Deployment:** Local dev-ready, cloud-ready (FastAPI compatible)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Setup (FastAPI + Supabase)

1. Create & activate virtual environment

```bash
cd be
python -m venv .venv
. .venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set environment variables (PowerShell example)

```powershell
$env:SUPABASE_URL = "<your-supabase-url>"
$env:SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE = "<your-supabase-service-role-key>"
$env:weather_api_key = "<your-weatherapi.com-key>"
```

4. Run the backend API

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

> Tip: Update checkpoint path in `be/Diseasedetect.py` if different.

---

## üíª Frontend Setup (Vite + React)

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd fe
npm install
```

2. Configure backend base URL

Create `.env` in `fe/` with:

```env
VITE_BE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

3. Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend URL: `http://localhost:5173`

## üîó Frontend ‚Üí Backend Wiring

| Component | API Calls / Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `pages/DiseaseDetection.jsx` | POST ``${VITE_BE_BASE_URL}/disease_detection?lat=..&lon=..``; POST ``${VITE_BE_BASE_URL}/disease_detection_detailed/`` |
| `pages/Recommend.jsx` | GET ``${VITE_BE_BASE_URL}/Crop_recommendation?lat=..&lon=..``; GET ``${VITE_BE_BASE_URL}/Crop_info?name=..`` |
| `pages/WeatherAlerts.jsx` | POST ``${VITE_BE_BASE_URL}/weatherforecast`` |
| `pages/Dashboard.jsx` and `pages/MapAlerts.jsx` | GET `/dashboard/data` ‚Üí temperature, rainfall, soil pH, altitude; red flags for detected diseases |
| `components/VoiceRecorder.jsx` | POST `/transcribe` ‚Üí AI-assisted crop listing |

---

## üì¶ Usage Notes

- Ensure Supabase keys are correctly configured
- Disease map alerts require latitude and longitude
- Marketplace supports both manual and AI-assisted crop listings
- All AI outputs are processed into clean JSON for frontend integration
